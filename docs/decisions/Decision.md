# 1. Decision on HTML Structure

**Date:** 2024-12-16

## Context
The HTML page we are building requires a well-defined structure to ensure accessibility, mobile compatibility, and ease of understanding for other developers.

- We decided to include a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page.
- A responsive design was implemented using semantic tags and the `meta` viewport tag.
- The priority was to keep the code clean and well-organized.

## Decision
- The navigation bar will be implemented using CSS with the `position: fixed` property.
- The layout will be responsive by using a flexible grid system with CSS Grid or Flexbox.
- Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` will be used to enhance accessibility.

## Rationale
- **Fixed navigation bar:** Improves user experience by allowing easy access to different sections without scrolling back to the top.
- **Responsive design:** Ensures the page is mobile-friendly and provides a good user experience across various screen sizes.
- **Semantic tags:** Enhance accessibility and make the page easier to interpret for screen readers and search engines.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Users will have a smoother experience.
- The design will appear modern and professional.
- The page will be easier to maintain and expand.

### Negative:
- The fixed navigation bar may take up space on small screens.
- Responsive design might require additional adjustments for cross-browser compatibility.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Static navigation bar:**  
   - Rejected because users would need to scroll back to the top repeatedly.
2. **Non-responsive design:**  
   - Rejected because it would limit usability on mobile devices.

## Status
**Decision implemented.**
